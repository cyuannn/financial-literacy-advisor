Overview

This Java program is designed to help users assess their current financial situation, set short-term and long-term financial goals, and receive personalized recommendations on budgeting, saving, and credit card usage. The program guides users through a series of prompts to input their financial details, including monthly income, expenses, credit card debt, and current savings. Users are also asked to specify their financial goals, such as short-term and long-term savings and debt reduction targets.


Features

Financial Assessment: The program calculates the user's potential monthly savings based on their income and expenses. It evaluates their current financial standing and provides insights into their savings potential.
Goal Setting: Users can set both short-term (within 1 year) and long-term (1-5 years) financial goals for savings and debt reduction. The program compares the user's financial potential against these goals and offers feedback on their progress.
Budgeting: The program allows users to input target monthly budgets for various categories, including housing, transportation, groceries, and discretionary spending. It checks if the total budgeted expenses are within the user's income and suggests adjustments if necessary.
Credit Card Recommendations: Based on the user's credit card debt and spending habits, the program provides tailored recommendations on the types of credit cards to consider, such as balance transfer cards for debt reduction, cash back cards for everyday purchases, and rewards cards for specific spending categories.
Suggestions: The program offers general financial advice, such as tracking expenses, using high-yield savings accounts, and periodically reviewing and adjusting the budget based on changes in income or expenses.
